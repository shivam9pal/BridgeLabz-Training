## Learning Approach

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Logic First | Build solutions without over-relying on built-in shortcuts |
| Clean Code | Write modular, reusable methods with clear naming |
| Edge Cases | Handle invalid input, overflow, and boundary conditions |
| Real-World Mapping | Scenario-based problems mirror actual use cases |
| Incremental Growth | Start simple, then add validation and optimization |

## Current Status

**Completed:** Core Java fundamentals, control flow, methods, arrays, strings and utility programs

**Next Steps:** Move to OOP concepts (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism) in separate branch

- **21-Dec-2025 (Sunday):** Continued with control flow. Practiced loops and conditionals.
- **22-Dec-2025 (Monday):** Solved and submitted basic practice problems.
- **23-Dec-2025 (Tuesday):** Solved practice problems set .
- **24-Dec-2025 (Wednesday):** Completed and submitted array and method problems.
- **25-Dec-2025 (Thursday):** Methods & String Manipulation problems solved.
- **26-Dec-2025 (Friday):** Number Validators and calculators completed.
- **27-Dec-2025 (Saturday):**  Scenario-based Problems implemented.
- **28-Dec-2025 (Sunday):**  Works with Java built in Date and time.
- **29-Dec-2025 (Monday):**  Completed Employee Wages Scenario based problem and also leetcode question.

### Week 2: Getting Started with Object-Oriented Programming

- **30-Dec-2025 (Tuesday):**  
  Designed and implemented a **Snake and Ladder** scenario-based program to understand real-world object modeling. Initiated learning of **Java OOPs concepts** by mapping game entities to classes and objects.
- **31-Dec-2025 (Wednesday):**  
  Learned and practiced **Classes & Objects**, **Constructors**, **Instance Variables**, and **Class Variables**. Focused on memory allocation, object lifecycle, and constructor usage with multiple examples.
- **01-Jan-2026 (Thursday):**  
  Studied **Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals**, covering OOP principles, object behavior, state, and interactions. Strengthened conceptual clarity through theory and basic implementations.
- **02-Jan-2026 (Friday):**  
  Explored **Java Constructors**, **Instance vs Class Variables**, and effective usage of **this**, **static**, and **final** keywords. Implemented small programs to understand scope, immutability, and shared data.
- **03-Jan-2026 (Saturday):**  
  Learned **Inheritance** in Java by implementing *IS-A relationships*. Understood method overriding, code reusability, and hierarchical class design using real-world examples.
- **05-Jan-2026 (Monday):**  
  Understood **Encapsulation**, **Polymorphism**, **Interface**, and **Abstract Class**. Learned data hiding principles, method overriding vs overloading, contract-based programming with interfaces, and abstract class implementation for creating extensible designs.
- **06-Jan-2026 (Tuesday):**  
  **BankingApp**, **CafetariaMenuApp**, **InvoiceGenerator**, **LibraryManagementSystem**, **MathUtilityLibrary**, **StudentQuizGrader**, **StudentScoreAnalyzer**
  Learned and practiced OOP concepts: Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Interfaces, and Abstract Classes.
-**07-Jan-2026 (Wednesday):**  
  **CabBookingApp**, **OnlineBankingSystem**
  Learned and implemented **real-world scenario–based applications** using Java.  
  Designed a **Cab Booking / Ride Management System** applying OOP concepts with `User`, `Driver`, and `Ride` classes, used **Interfaces** (`FareCalculator`) and **Polymorphism** for peak vs normal pricing, and handled edge cases using **custom exceptions** (`NoDriverAvailableException`).  

  Also developed an **Online Banking System** supporting account creation, balance check, fund transfer, and transaction history.  
  Practiced **Inheritance** (`Account → SavingsAccount / CurrentAccount`), **Abstraction** via `BankService` interface, **Polymorphism** for interest calculation, **custom exception handling** (`InsufficientBalanceException`), and **Multithreading with synchronization** to ensure thread-safe concurrent transactions.

  Learned and practiced advanced OOP concepts: **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Interfaces, Exception Handling.
