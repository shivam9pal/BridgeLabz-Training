## Learning Approach

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Logic First | Build solutions without over-relying on built-in shortcuts |
| Clean Code | Write modular, reusable methods with clear naming |
| Edge Cases | Handle invalid input, overflow, and boundary conditions |
| Real-World Mapping | Scenario-based problems mirror actual use cases |
| Incremental Growth | Start simple, then add validation and optimization |

---

## Current Status

**Completed:** Core Java fundamentals, control flow, methods, arrays, strings and utility programs

**Next Steps:** Move to OOP concepts (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism) in separate branch
